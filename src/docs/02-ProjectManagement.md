# Project Management

CodexLotus organizes your work into **Projects**. A project is a folder on your computer containing all your content files, assets, and configuration.

## Creating a New Project

1. Go to **File > New Project...**
2. Select a folder where you want to create your project.
3. CodexLotus will initialize the folder with a basic structure.

## Opening an Existing Project

1. Go to **File > Open Project...**
2. Select the folder containing your CodexLotus project.

## Importing Files

You can import existing markdown files or text documents into your project:

1. Go to **File > Import Files...**
2. Select the files you wish to add to your project.
3. They will be copied into your project directory.

## Project Structure

The sidebar (Explorer) shows the files in your project. You can organize them into folders as you see fit. CodexLotus uses standard Markdown files (`.md`), so your content is always accessible even outside the app.
