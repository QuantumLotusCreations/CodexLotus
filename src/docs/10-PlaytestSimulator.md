# Playtest Simulator

The **Playtest Simulator** (Scenario Simulator) allows you to run simulated battles or scenarios to test your rules.

1. Go to **Tools > Scenario Simulator**.
2. Define the combatants (Party vs. Monsters).
3. Set the rules/parameters for the simulation.
4. Run the simulation.
5. View the results log to see how the battle played out, who won, and resource usage.

This is invaluable for stress-testing your game balance without needing a group of players.
