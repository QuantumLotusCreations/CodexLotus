# Stat Blocks

CodexLotus allows you to define and render complex stat blocks for monsters, items, spells, and more.

## Stat Block Designer

The **Stat Block Designer** is a visual tool for creating stat blocks without writing code manually.

1. Go to **Tools > Stat Block Designer**.
2. Use the form to fill in details like Name, Type, AC, HP, Abilities, and Actions.
3. The preview updates in real-time.
4. You can save stat blocks as templates or copy the Markdown code to paste into your documents.

## Markdown Syntax for Stat Blocks

Stat blocks are defined in your markdown files using specific code blocks. CodexLotus renders these as formatted boxes in the preview.

Example:
\`\`\`statblock
name: Goblin
type: Small Humanoid (Goblinoid)
ac: 15
hp: 7 (2d6)
...
\`\`\`

(Note: The specific syntax may depend on the active template system).
