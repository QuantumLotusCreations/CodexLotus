# Rule Calculators

CodexLotus provides specialized calculators to help balance various aspects of your TTRPG system.

## Accessing Calculators

Go to **Tools > Rule Calculators**. The tab contains several sub-tools:

### XP Calculator
Estimate the Experience Point (XP) value for monsters or encounters based on their difficulty, hit points, and damage output.

### Economy Calculator
Balance your game's economy. Input costs for items, services, and treasure rewards to ensure players have appropriate purchasing power at each level.

### Ability Cost Calculator
Determine the "point cost" or balance weight of special abilities, spells, or feats based on their effects (damage, duration, range, etc.).

### Encounter Calculator
Design balanced encounters by inputting the party level and size, and selecting monsters to see the calculated difficulty rating.
