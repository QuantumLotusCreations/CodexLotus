# Lore Map

The **Lore Map** helps you visualize the connections in your world.

1. Go to **Tools > Lore Map**.
2. The map displays nodes representing entities (Characters, Locations, Factions, Items).
3. Links between nodes represent relationships.

## Automatic Graph Building

CodexLotus analyzes your project files to build this graph automatically. It looks for links between files (e.g., `[[Character Name]]`) and infers relationships based on content references.

## Navigating the Map

- **Zoom/Pan**: Use your mouse to move around the graph.
- **Click Node**: Click a node to open the corresponding file or view details.
