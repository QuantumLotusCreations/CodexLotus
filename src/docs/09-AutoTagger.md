# Auto Tagger

The **Auto Tagger** helps maintain consistency across your project by finding unlinked references.

## How it Works

1. Go to **Tools > Auto Tagger**.
2. The tool scans your text for keywords that match the names of existing files or defined terms in your project.
3. It identifies instances where these terms appear but are not linked (e.g., "The goblin attacked" where "Goblin" is a known entity but not linked).

## Applying Tags

- Review the suggested tags.
- Click **Apply** to automatically convert the plain text into a link (e.g., `[[Goblin]]`).
- This ensures your Lore Map remains accurate and your documentation is easy to navigate.
