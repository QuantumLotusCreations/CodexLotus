# Markdown Editor

The core of CodexLotus is a powerful Markdown editor designed for RPG writing.

## Basic Editing

Click on any file in the Explorer to open it in the editor. The editor supports standard Markdown syntax:

- **Bold**: `**text**`
- *Italic*: `*text*`
- # Headings: `# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`, etc.
- Lists: `- Item` or `1. Item`
- Links: `[Text](url)`

1. Click the **✨ AI Edit** button in the toolbar.
2. Enter an instruction (e.g., "Rewrite this description to be more ominous" or "Fix grammar errors").
3. Click **Generate Edit**.
4. Review the changes in the Diff Viewer.
5. Click **Accept Changes** to apply them or **Discard** to cancel.
